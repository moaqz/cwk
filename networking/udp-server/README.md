# UDP Server

Implement a simple client-server application with the following functionalities:

1. The client will read a line of characters (data) from its keyboard and send the data to the server.
2. The server will receive the data and convert the characters to uppercase.
3. The server will send the modified data back to the client.
4. The client will receive the modified data and display the line on its screen.
